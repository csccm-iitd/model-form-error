# Model-form-error
Physics-integrated hybrid framework for model form error identification in nonlinear dynamical systems

The GitHub repository contains sample MATLAB codes and the relevant data for the case studies carried out in the research paper titled 'Physics-integrated hybrid framework for model form error identification in nonlinear dynamical systems'.
Please go through the research paper to understand the implemented algorithm.

Note: Because of presence of Gaussian white noise and stochastic differential equations results may vary for different runs of the programs.
